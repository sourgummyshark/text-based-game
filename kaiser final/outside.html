      <p>  YOU COME ACROSS A CABIN IN A DENSE FOREST. WHILE
          IT SEEMS STRANGE, BUT ALSO SO FAMILAR YOU COULD ALMOST PLACE IT.
          YOUR BODY ACHES FROM YOUR JOURNEY, THE WALK HAD FELT UNENDING BEFORE
          THIS CABIN. AS THE SUN BEATS DOWN OVERHEAD, IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND
          NIGHT LOOMS IN THIS ALREADY DARK FOREST.</p>

      <p> IT SEEMS WELCOMING ENOUGH.</p>
